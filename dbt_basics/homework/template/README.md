# **🚀 Getting Started**

## **Prerequisites**

1. **Python >= 3.9**

## **Local Development**

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open a terminal, navigate to your desired directory, and clone the repository using:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:DataExpert-io/analytics-engineering-bootcamp-homework.git # clone the repo
    cd analytics-engineering-bootcamp-homework # navigate into the new folder
    ```

    1. If you don’t have SSH configured with the GitHub CLI, please follow the instructions for [generating a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and [adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account?tool=cli) in the GitHub docs.



## dbt Project Setup

-  **Create a Branch:**
    - Navigate to the **`analytics-engineering-bootcamp-homework/dbt_basics/homework`** folder on your local machine.
    - Use the **`git checkout -b`** command to create a new branch where you can commit and push your changes. Prefix your branch name with your Git username to avoid conflicts.
          For example:

        ```bash
        git checkout -b homework/my-git-username
        ```
    - Create a copy of the **`template/`** folder and rename it to **`<your-git-username>`**, for example **`dbt_basics/homework/bruno`**.

- Go to the project's directory, assuming you are already in the **`homework`** folder:
  ```bash
  cd <your-git-username>
  ```
- Create a venv to isolate required packages
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv # MacOS/Linux
  # or
  python -m venv venv # Windows/PC
  ```
- Source the virtual environment
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate # MacOS/Linux
  # or
  venv/Scripts/activate # Windows/PC
  ```
- Install the required packages
  ```bash
  pip3 install -r dbt-requirements.txt # MacOS/Linux
  # or
  pip install -r dbt-requirements.txt # Windows/PC
  ```
- Update `DBT_SCHEMA` environment variable
  - MacOS/Linux:
    - Open the `dbt.env` file, change the `DBT_SCHEMA` to your schema from Weeks 1 and 2, and source the environment variables to your local (terminal) environment
      ```bash
      export DBT_SCHEMA='your_schema' # EDIT THIS FIELD
      ```
    - then run
      ```bash
      source dbt.env
      ```
  - Windows/PC:
    - Instead of overwriting the DBT_SCHEMA in the file you can run:
      - CMD:
      ```bash
      set DBT_SCHEMA=your_schema

      # For example
      set DBT_SCHEMA=bruno #(without quotes)
      ```
      - PowerShell:
      ```bash
      $env:DBT_SCHEMA = "your_schema"

      # For example
      $env:DBT_SCHEMA = "bruno"
      ```


- Run `dbt debug` to check your connection. You should see a message like this:
    ```
    21:43:08  Running with dbt=1.8.0
    21:43:08  dbt version: 1.8.0

# 📊 dbt Assignment

**🎃 Welcome to the Haunted House Extravaganza! 👻🎟️**
Step into the data-filled world of thrills and chills as you venture into a theme park with 10 spine-tingling haunted houses!

🏚️ Your mission this week? Manage all the creepy customer tickets, terrifying feedback, and haunted house details lurking in the shadows. 💀

--

Remember that, if you are running your project for the first time, dbt will ask you to run

```bash
$ dbt deps
```

to install the packages defined in packages.yml

## Steps

### 1 - Add new sources

Inside the `models/staging` folder, create a source YAML file called `_sources.yml` and add the sources:
- `bootcamp.raw_customers`
- `bootcamp.raw_customer_feedbacks`
- `bootcamp.raw_haunted_houses`
- `bootcamp.raw_haunted_house_tickets`
to the `_sources.yml` file in the `models/staging` folder. (more info about sources here https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/sources)

### 2 - Create base models

Inside the `models/staging` folder, create a base model for each source (In dbt we call them staging models).
- `stg_customers.sql`
- `stg_customer_feedbacks.sql`
- `stg_haunted_houses.sql`
- `stg_haunted_house_tickets.sql`

These models should pull data from the sources. (use the `{{ source() }}` function we saw in the lab and lecture), and it should select all columns.

You can use the `codegen` function we saw in the lab to generate the base models (https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-codegen/tree/0.12.1/#create_base_models-source). Just change the name of the file later.

> :bulb: Note:
>
> You run your models by running in the terminal:
> - `dbt run` (To run all the models in the project)
>or
>- `dbt run -s stg_customers` (To run the specific model)
>

Inside the `models/staging` folder, create a YAML file for each model to include tests.
- `stg_customers.yml`
- `stg_customer_feedbacks.yml`
- `stg_haunted_houses.yml`
- `stg_haunted_house_tickets.yml`


Add at least `unique`and `not_null` tests to the primary keys. Feel free to add more tests to other columns. [More info about tests here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/data-tests#generic-data-tests).

> :bulb: Note:
>
> You test your models by running in the terminal:
> - `dbt test` (To test all the models in the project)
>or
>- `dbt test -s stg_customers` (To test the specific model)
>

> :bulb: Note:
>
> You run AND test your models by running in the terminal:
> - `dbt build` (To run AND test all the models in the project)
>or
>- `dbt build -s stg_customers` (To run AND test the specific model)
>


_(Optional) You can add documentation to your models. [Here's how to do it](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/documentation#adding-descriptions-to-your-project)._

### 3 - Create a seed for valid email domains

As part of the logic of a _Dimension Table_ we will create in the next step, we want to validate the accepeted email domains for customers.

To be able to do it, we need to create a list of valid email domains. This is a good use-case for a seed. [More info about seeds here](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/seeds).

Inside the **`seeds/`** folder, create a CSV file named **`**valid_domains.csv`**.

This CSV should have one single column name **`valid_domain`**, and two rows:
- `@example.com`
- `@example.io`

> :bulb: Note:
>
> You can run your seed by running in the terminal:
> - `dbt seed` (To run all the seeds in the project)
>or
>- `dbt seed -s valid_domains` (To run the specific seed)
>

### 4 - Create the Fact and Dimension tables

#### 4.1 - fact_visits
We will create a fact table to display information about a customer's visit to a haunted_house.

Inside the **`models/marts`** folder, create the fact_visits SQL file **`fact_visits.sql`**

Use your SQL skills to select the data from the models:
- `stg_haunted_house_tickets`
- `stg_customer_feedbacks`

When selecting from another model, use the `{{ ref('model_name') }}` function.

And join them to display all this information:
- `ticket_id`
- `customer_id`
- `haunted_house_id`
- `purchase_date`
- `visit_date`
- `ticket_type`
- `ticket_price`
- `rating`
- `comments`

--

Inside the **`models/marts`** folder, create the fact_visits YAML file **`fact_visits.yml`**.

Add at least `unique`and `not_null` tests to the primary key.

#### 4.2 - dim_haunted_houses

Inside the **`models/marts`** folder, create the fact_visits SQL file **`dim_haunted_houses.sql`**

Use your SQL skills to select the data from the model:
- `stg_haunted_houses`

When selecting from another model, use the `{{ ref('model_name') }}` function.

Display all this information:
- `haunted_house_id`
- `house_name`
- `park_area`
- `theme`
- `fear_level`
- `house_size_in_ft2` (The original `house_size` columns)
- `house_size_in_m2` (read below)

_(Optional) The column `house_size_in_m2` can be calculated using a [macro](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros). For that, you can follow the [dbt guide](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/jinja-macros#macros) to declare your macro and call it in your model._

--

Inside the **`models/marts`** folder, create the fact_visits YAML file **`dim_haunted_houses.yml`**.

Add at least `unique`and `not_null` tests to the primary key.

#### 4.3 - dim_customers

Inside the **`models/marts`** folder, create the fact_visits SQL file **`dim_customers.sql`**

Use your SQL skills to select the data from the model and seed:
- `stg_customers`
- `valid_domains`

When selecting from another model/seed, use the `{{ ref('model_name') }}` function.

Display all this information:
- `customer_id`
- `age`
- `gender`
- `email`
- `is_valid_email_address` (read below)

You will need to create a logic that uses the `valid_domains` seed to check if the customer has a valid email address.

A valid email address is an email:
- Containing a `@` separating the username from the domain.
- Containing a `.` in the domain.
- Having a domain listed in `valid_domains`.
[You can use this doc as referece to this validation, it is literally the same thing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/unit-tests#unit-testing-a-model).

--

Inside the **`models/marts`** folder, create the fact_visits YAML file **`dim_customers.yml`**.

Add at least `unique`and `not_null` tests to the primary key.

### (Optional) 5 - Add custom tests

#### (Optional) 5.1 Custom generic test
Inside the **`tests/generic`** folder, create file named **`is_positive.sql`**.

Inside this file, create a [generic test](https://docs.getdbt.com/best-practices/writing-custom-generic-tests) called `is_positive`, that asserts if the column has only positive values.

Add this test to the **`ticket_price`** column in **`models/staging/stg_haunted_house_tickets`**.



#### (Optional) 5.2 Unit test
Inside the **`models/marts/dim_customers.yml`** file, create a _unit test_ that checks if your logic to validate emails are right.

[You can use this doc as referece, it is literally the same thing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/build/unit-tests#unit-testing-a-model).

> :bulb: Just remember of including the example.io case too.
